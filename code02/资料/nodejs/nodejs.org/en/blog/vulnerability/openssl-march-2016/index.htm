                <p><strong><em>(Updates to this post, including a schedule change are included below)</em></strong></p>
<p>The OpenSSL project has <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-February/000063.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-February/000063.html%27" tppabs="https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-February/000063.html">announced</a> that that they will be releasing versions 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s this week, on <strong>Tuesday the 1st of March, UTC</strong>. The releases will fix <em>&quot;several defects&quot;</em> that are labelled as <em>&quot;high&quot;</em> severity under their security policy, meaning they are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... issues that are of a lower risk than critical, perhaps due to affecting less common configurations, or which are less likely to be exploitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Node.js v0.10 and v0.12 both use OpenSSL v1.0.1 and Node.js v4 and v5 both use OpenSSL v1.0.2 and releases from nodejs.org and some other popular distribution sources are statically compiled. Therefore, all active release lines are impacted by this update.</p>
<p>At this stage, due to embargo, it is uncertain the exact nature of these defects, nor what impact they will have on Node.js users, if any.</p>
<p>As we already had minor, non-security releases scheduled for each of our active release lines during this week and next, we will be adjusting our schedule to adapt to the OpenSSL releases depending on their impact on Node.js users.</p>
<p>We will therefore proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Within approximately 24 hours of the OpenSSL releases, our crypto team will make an impact assessment for Node.js users of the OpenSSL releases. This information may vary depending for the different active release lines and will be posted here.</p>
<p>As part of that impact assessment we will announce our release plans for each of the active release lines to take into account any impact. <strong>Please be prepared for the possibility of important updates to Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4 and v5 soon after Tuesday, the 1st of March.</strong></p>
<h3>Node.js v0.10 (Maintenance)<a name="node-js-v0-10-maintenance" class="anchor" href="#node-js-v0-10-maintenance"></a></h3><p>A release of Node.js v0.10.43 has been proposed for this week, it currently contains fixes for domains and an important fix for a regression in http_parser that was introduced in v0.10.42. Details of the changes included in this release along with instructions on how to download and use a release candidate (v0.10.43-rc.1) can be found in <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5404  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5404%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5404">https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5404</a>. Node.js v0.10 users are encouraged to test the release candidate build to ensure compatibility with existing deployments.</p>
<p>If the OpenSSL 1.0.1s release contains important fixes that impact Node.js v0.10 we will endeavour to ensure that our v0.10.43 release contains the update.</p>
<h3>Node.js v0.12 (LTS)<a name="node-js-v0-12-lts" class="anchor" href="#node-js-v0-12-lts"></a></h3><p>A release of Node.js v0.12.11 has been proposed for this week, it currently contains fixes for domains, an important fix for a regression in http_parser that was introduced in v0.12.10, and some other minor fixes. Details of the changes included in this release along with instructions on how to download and use a release candidate (v0.12.11-rc.1) can be found in <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5403  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5403%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5403">https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5403</a>. Node.js v0.12 users are encouraged to test the release candidate build to ensure compatibility with existing deployments.</p>
<p>If the OpenSSL 1.0.1s release contains important fixes for Node.js v0.12 we will endevour to ensure that our v0.12.11 release contains the update.</p>
<h3>Node.js v4 (LTS &quot;Argon&quot;)<a name="node-js-v4-lts-argon" class="anchor" href="#node-js-v4-lts-argon"></a></h3><p>A significant update to Node.js v4 has been proposed for next week, the 8th of March. You can read about what will be included in Node.js v4.4.0 and find release candidates to test against your deployments at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5301  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5301%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5301">https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5301</a>.</p>
<p>If the OpenSSL 1.0.2g update includes important fixes that impact Node.js v4, we may release a v4.3.2 <em>this week</em> with only the security updates in order to provide a low-risk path for Node.js v4 users.</p>
<p>If the OpenSSL 1.0.2g update <em>does not include</em> important fixes that impact Node.js v4, we will continue with our planned v4.4.0 release and also attempt to include the OpenSSL 1.0.2g upgrade. Users of Node.js v4 can then upgrade to v4.4.0 in their own time and allow for proper testing of the changes included.</p>
<h3>Node.js v5 (Stable)<a name="node-js-v5-stable" class="anchor" href="#node-js-v5-stable"></a></h3><p>A regular update to Node.js v5 has been proposed for this week. You can read about what will be included in the proposed Node.js v5.7.1 at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5464  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5464%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5464">https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5464</a>. We are excluding any semver-minor changes from this release although it has fixes for some regressions </p>
<p>If the OpenSSL 1.0.2g release contains important fixes for Node.js v5, we will endevour to ensure that our v5.7.1 release contains the update.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Modern servers and clients use the TLS encryption protocol. However, due to misconfigurations, many servers also still support SSLv2, a 1990s-era predecessor to TLS. This support did not matter in practice, since no up-to-date clients actually use SSLv2. Therefore, even though SSLv2 is known to be badly insecure, until now, merely supporting SSLv2 was not considered a security problem, because clients never used it.</p>
<p>DROWN shows that merely supporting SSLv2 is a threat to modern servers and clients. It allows an attacker to decrypt modern TLS connections between up-to-date clients and servers by sending probes to a server that supports SSLv2 and uses the same private key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that simply supporting SSLv2 on an HTTPS socket enables this vulnerability, regardless of whether clients are actively using SSLv2.</p>
<p>Since Node.js v0.10.29, SSLv2 and SSLv3 have been disabled by default. It has remained possible to enable them with the <code>--enable-ssl2</code> and <code>--enable-ssl3</code> command-line arguments to <code>node</code>. As these protocols have consistently been demonstrated to be insecure, keeping SSLv2 and SSLv3 disabled has been strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>If you are using the <code>--enable-ssl2</code> command-line argument with <code>node</code> then HTTPS servers are vulnerable to this attack. You should stop using this argument to avoid potential decryption of your secure data.</p>
<p><strong>SSLv2 support is being removed</strong></p>
<p>Given the additional barriers introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.1s to retaining SSLv2 support and the long list of known SSLv2 vulnerabilities, Node.js v0.10.43 and v0.12.11 will be completely remove SSLv2 support and the <code>--enable-ssl2</code> command-line argument.</p>

<p>This defect can cause memory corruption in certain very rare cases. Additionally, the <code>BN_hex2bn()</code> and <code>BN_dec2bn()</code> functions are not explicitly used in Node.js, however they are used internally by OpenSSL for some APIs. While we are unable to confirm with certainty at this stage, we believe that Node.js is not invoking the code paths that use these functions.</p>
<p>Combined with the difficulty of exploiting this defect and the likelihood that Node.js is not using APIs that require the internal use of these functions, this defect is considered to have a very low severity for Node.js users.</p>

<p>This defect can serve as a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vector or be used for causing memory corruption. The <code>BIO_*printf()</code> functions are used internally by OpenSSL, however the only path by which an API call by Node.js invokes these functions has a default certificate size limit, which is not changed by Node.js, that removes the possibility of exploiting this defect. Therefore we believe that Node.js is unaffected by this defect.</p>
