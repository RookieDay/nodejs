<p>Company Looks to Accelerate Node.js Adoption for Enterprise Software Development</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 6, 2015</strong> – The <a href="../../../foundation/index.htm" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/">Node.js Foundation</a>, a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today announced Red Hat, Inc. has joined the Foundation as a Platinum member. Red Hat joins platinum members, including Famous, IBM, Intel, Joyent, Microsoft and PayPal, to provide support in the adoption, development and long-term success of the Node.js project.</p>
<p>Node.js is the runtime of choice for high-performance, low latency applications, powering everything from enterprise applications to robots. Over the last two years, more large enterprises, including Red Hat, IBM, PayPal, Fidelity, and Microsoft, have adopted Node.js as part of their enterprise fabric. Today there are 2 million unique IP addresses installing Node.js packages and more than 2 billion package downloads in the last month.</p>
<p>Often used for building fast, scalable network applications, Node.js supports Red Hat technologies such as <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform%27" tppabs="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform">Red Hat Mobile Application Platform</a>, and is available in <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.openshift.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.openshift.com/%27" tppabs="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift by Red Hat</a> and <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://developerblog.redhat.com/tag/software-collections/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://developerblog.redhat.com/tag/software-collections/%27" tppabs="http://developerblog.redhat.com/tag/software-collections/">Red Hat Software Collections</a>. As a new member, Red Hat is providing financial support, technical contributions, and high-level policy guidance for the newly formed Foundation that operates as a neutral organization to support the project governed by the Node.js community.</p>
<p>“Node.js has become an important tool for developers who need to build and deploy a new generation of highly responsive, scalable applications for mobile and Internet of Things (IoT),” said Rich Sharples, senior director, Product Management at Red Hat. “We welcome deeper collaboration with the Node.js Foundation and broader community, and look forward to helping increase the role that the technology plays in enterprise software development.”</p>
<p>“Node.js is exploding in popularity in almost every aspect of technology from microservices architecture to data-intensive applications that run across distributed devices,” said Danese Cooper, Chairperson of the Node.js Foundation Board. “It is a pivotal moment for the technology, and the support of Foundation members is imperative to ensure that Node.js stays relevant and addresses topical projects and problems that are happening within the wider Node.js community.”</p>
