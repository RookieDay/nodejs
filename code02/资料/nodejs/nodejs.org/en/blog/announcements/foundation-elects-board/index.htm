<p>“The new board members represent the diversity of the Node.js community and the commitment that these companies have to supporting its overall efforts,” said Danese Cooper, chairman of the board, Node.js Foundation. “Node.js is incredibly important to the developer ecosystem and is increasingly relevant for building applications on devices that are changing the pace of commerce. The board will work to support and build the Node.js platform using the blueprint of an open governance model that is transparent and supportive of its community.”</p>
<p>In early June, the Node.js and io.js developer community announced that they were merging their respective code base to continue their work in a neutral forum, the Node.js Foundation. The new leaders will help support the ongoing growth and evolution of the combined communities and will foster a collaborative environment to accelerate growth and the platform’s evolution.</p>
