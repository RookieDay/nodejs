                <p>Are You Ready for Node.js Interactive?</p>
<p>The Node.js Foundation is pleased to announce <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://interactive.nodejs.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://interactive.nodejs.org/%27" tppabs="http://interactive.nodejs.org/">Node.js Interactive</a> happening from December 8-9, 2015 in Portland, OR. With node.js growing in all aspects of technology, the gathering will cover everything from streamlining development of fast websites and real-time applications to tips for managing node.js applications, and much more.</p>
<p>The event will be the first of its kind under the Node.js Foundation led in cooperation with The Linux Foundation. Vendor-neutral by design, it will focus on the continued ideals of open governance collaboration between the now joined node.js and io.js community. The conference welcomes experienced developers as well as those interested in how node.js might be of use to their business with tracks that focus on IoT, front-end and back-end technologies. To curate these tracks and create the best experience for attendees, track chairs include seasoned veterans:</p>
