<p>Inaugural Conference to Advance the Use of Node.js Within Backend, Frontend, IoT Applications</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20, 2015 – <a href="../../../foundation/index.htm" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/">The Node.js Foundation</a>, a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today announced initial programming for <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive%27" tppabs="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive">Node.js Interactive</a>. This inaugural event, which is being led by the newly formed Node.js Foundation in cooperation with the Linux Foundation, will be held December 8-9, 2015, in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>Node.js has become ubiquitous in almost every ecosystem in technology and is consistently being used more in mainstream enterprises. To continue to evolve the platform, Node.js Interactive brings together a wide range of community, projects, products and companies to create an educational and collaborative space. With more than 700 attendees expected, Node.js Interactive will provide a way to network with other developers and engineers within this diverse community.  </p>
<p>Node.js Interactive will also focus on three tracks: Frontend, Backend and the Internet of Things (IoT); talks for each track were selected in collaboration with track chairs <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/jlord/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/jlord/%27" tppabs="https://github.com/jlord/">Jessica Lord</a> (Frontend), <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/ceejbot  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/ceejbot%27" tppabs="https://github.com/ceejbot">C J Silvero</a> (Backend) and <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodebotanist  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodebotanist%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodebotanist">Kassandra Perch</a> (IoT).
