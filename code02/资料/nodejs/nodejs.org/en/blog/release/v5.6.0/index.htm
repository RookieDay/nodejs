                <p>This is an important security release.

<h3>Notable changes<a name="notable-changes" class="anchor" href="#notable-changes"></a></h3><ul>
<li><strong>http</strong>: fix defects in HTTP header parsing for requests and responses that can allow request smuggling (CVE-2016-2086) or response splitting (CVE-2016-2216). HTTP header parsing now aligns more closely with the HTTP spec including restricting the acceptable characters.</li>
<li><strong>http-parser</strong>: upgrade from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1</li>
<li><strong>npm</strong>: upgrade npm from 3.3.12 to 3.6.0 (Rebecca Turner) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4958  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4958%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4958">#4958</a></li>
<li><strong>openssl</strong>: upgrade from 1.0.2e to 1.0.2f. To mitigate against the Logjam attack, TLS clients now reject Diffie-Hellman handshakes with parameters shorter than 1024-bits, up from the previous limit of 768-bits.</li>
