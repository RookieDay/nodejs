<p><em>Update</em>: The version of npm included in this release did not have the correct version string. As such executing <code>npm -v</code> will report <code>2.15.0</code> rather than <code>2.15.1</code>, which is incorrect. The source code included in this release is in fact the source for <code>2.15.1</code>, including the security fix.</p>
<h3>Notable Changes<a name="notable-changes" class="anchor" href="#notable-changes"></a></h3><ul>
<li><strong>https</strong>:<ul>
<li>Under certain conditions ssl sockets may have been causing a memory leak when keepalive is enabled. This is no longer the case. (Alexander Penev) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5713  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5713%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5713">#5713</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>lib</strong>:<ul>
<li>The way that we were internally passing arguments was causing a potential leak. By copying the arguments into an array we can avoid this. (Nathan Woltman) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4361  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4361%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4361">#4361</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>npm</strong>: <ul>
<li>Upgrade to v2.15.1. Fixes a security flaw in the use of authentication tokens in HTTP requests that would allow an attacker to set up a server that could collect tokens from users of the command-line interface. Authentication tokens have previously been sent with every request made by the CLI for logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. This update fixes this by only including those tokens for requests made against the registry or registries used for the current install. (Forrest L Norvell)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>repl</strong>:<ul>
<li>Previously if you were using the repl in strict mode the column number would be wrong in a stack trace. This is no longer an issue.
