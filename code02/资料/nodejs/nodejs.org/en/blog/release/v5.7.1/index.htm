<li><strong>governance</strong>: The Core Technical Committee (CTC) added four new members to help guide Node.js core development: Evan Lucas, Rich Trott, Ali Ijaz Sheikh and Сковорода Никита Андреевич (Nikita Skovoroda).</li>
<li><strong>openssl</strong>: Upgrade from 1.0.2f to 1.0.2g (Ben Noordhuis) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5507  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5507%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5507">#5507</a>.<ul>
<li>Fix a double-free defect in parsing malformed DSA keys that may potentially be used for DoS or memory corruption attacks. It is likely to be very difficult to use this defect for a practical attack and is therefore considered low severity for Node.js users. More info is available at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0705%27" tppabs="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0705">CVE-2016-0705</a>.</li>
<li>Fix a defect that can cause memory corruption in certain very rare cases relating to the internal <code>BN_hex2bn()</code> and <code>BN_dec2bn()</code> functions. It is believed that Node.js is not invoking the code paths that use these functions so practical attacks via Node.js using this defect are <em>unlikely</em> to be possible. More info is available at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0797%27" tppabs="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0797">CVE-2016-0797</a>.</li>

This defect enables attackers to execute side-channel attacks leading to the potential recovery of entire RSA private keys. It only affects the Intel Sandy Bridge (and possibly older) microarchitecture when using hyper-threading. Newer microarchitectures, including Haswell, are unaffected.
