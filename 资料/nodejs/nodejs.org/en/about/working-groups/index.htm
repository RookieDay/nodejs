as used in Node.js and the npm ecosystem. We seek to create a composable API that
solves the problem of representing multiple occurrences of an event over time
in a humane, low-overhead fashion. Improvements to the API will be driven by
the needs of the ecosystem; interoperability and backwards compatibility with
other solutions and prior versions are paramount in importance. Our
responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.</li>
<li>Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.</li>
<li>Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.</li>
<li>Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this project.</li>
<li>Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.</li>
<li>Recommending versions of readable-stream to be included in Node.js.</li>
<li>Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance notice of changes.</li>

<h3>i18n<a name="i18n" class="anchor" href="#i18n"></a></h3><p>The i18n working groups handle more than just translations. They
are endpoints for community members to collaborate with each
other in their language of choice.</p>
<p>Each team is organized around a common spoken language. Each
language community might then produce multiple localizations for
various project resources.</p>
<p>Their responsibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translations of any Node.js materials they believe are relevant to their
community.</li>
<li>Review processes for keeping translations up
to date and of high quality.</li>
<li>Social media channels in their language.</li>
<li>Promotion of Node.js speakers for meetups and conferences in their
language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the i18n working groups are distinct from the <a href="#Intl">Intl</a> working group.</p>
<p>Each language community maintains its own membership.</p>
