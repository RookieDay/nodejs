which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.</p>
<p>The TSC has final authority over this project including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical direction</li>
<li>Project governance and process (including this policy)</li>
<li>Contribution policy</li>
<li>GitHub repository hosting</li>
<li>Conduct guidelines</li>
<li>Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial membership invitations to the TSC were given to individuals who
had been active contributors, and who have significant
experience with the management of the project. Membership is
expected to evolve over time according to the needs of the project.</p>
<p>For the current list of TSC members, see the project

maintained by the TSC and additional Collaborators who are added by the
TSC on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the TSC and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during the weekly TSC meeting.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access, log an issue or contact a TSC member directly and it
will be brought up in the next TSC meeting.</p>
<p>Modifications of the contents of the nodejs/node repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See <em>Consensus Seeking Process</em> below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.</p>
<p>Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
TSC for discussion by assigning the <strong><em>tsc-agenda</em></strong> tag to a pull
request or issue. The TSC should serve as the final arbiter where
required.</p>

<h2>TSC Membership<a name="tsc-membership" class="anchor" href="#tsc-membership"></a></h2><p>TSC seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the TSC.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.</p>
<p>There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TSC
membership beyond these rules.</p>
<p>The TSC may add additional members to the TSC by a standard TSC motion.</p>
<p>A TSC member may be removed from the TSC by voluntary resignation, or by
a standard TSC motion.</p>
<p>Changes to TSC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see &quot;TSC Meetings&quot; below).</p>
<p>No more than 1/3 of the TSC members may be affiliated with the same
employer.  If removal or resignation of a TSC member, or a change of
employment by a TSC member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
the TSC membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more TSC
members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).</p>
<h2>TSC Meetings<a name="tsc-meetings" class="anchor" href="#tsc-meetings"></a></h2><p>The TSC meets weekly on a Google Hangout On Air. The meeting is run by
a designated moderator approved by the TSC. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.</p>
<p>Items are added to the TSC agenda which are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, TSC membership,
or release process.</p>
<p>The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches.
That should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.</p>
<p>Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting&#39;s agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
TSC member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the <strong><em>tsc-agenda</em></strong> tag to the issue.</p>
<p>Prior to each TSC meeting, the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the TSC. TSC members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the TSC
cannot veto or remove items.</p>
<p>The TSC may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity. These invitees currently are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A representative from <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/node-forward/build  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/node-forward/build%27" tppabs="https://github.com/node-forward/build">build</a>
chosen by that project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sending it as a pull request after the meeting.</p>
<h2>Consensus Seeking Process<a name="consensus-seeking-process" class="anchor" href="#consensus-seeking-process"></a></h2><p>The TSC follows a
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making">Consensus Seeking</a>
decision making model.</p>
<p>When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask &quot;Does anyone object?&quot; as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.</p>
<p>If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a TSC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be approved by a majority of the TSC
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.</p>
