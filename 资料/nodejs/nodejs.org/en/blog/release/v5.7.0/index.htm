<li><strong>buffer</strong>:<ul>
<li>You can now supply an <code>encoding</code> argument when filling a Buffer <code>Buffer#fill(string[, start[, end]][, encoding])</code>, supplying an existing Buffer will also work with <code>Buffer#fill(buffer[, start[, end]])</code>. See the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_fill_value_offset_end_encoding%27" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_fill_value_offset_end_encoding">API documentation</a> for details on how this works.

<li><code>Buffer#indexOf()</code> no longer requires a <code>byteOffset</code> argument if you also wish to specify an <code>encoding</code>: <code>Buffer#indexOf(val[, byteOffset][, encoding])</code>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>child_process</strong>: <code>spawn()</code> and <code>spawnSync()</code> now support a <code>&#39;shell&#39;</code> option to allow for optional execution of the given command inside a shell. If set to <code>true</code>, <code>cmd.exe</code> will be used on Windows and <code>/bin/sh</code> elsewhere. A path to a custom shell can also be passed to override these defaults. On Windows, this option allows <code>.bat.</code> and <code>.cmd</code> files to be executed with <code>spawn()</code> and <code>spawnSync()</code>. (Colin Ihrig) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4598  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4598%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4598">#4598</a></li>

<li><strong>http</strong>: Fix a bug where handling headers will mistakenly trigger an <code>&#39;upgrade&#39;</code> event where the server is just advertising its protocols. This bug can prevent HTTP clients from communicating with HTTP/2 enabled servers. (Fedor Indutny) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4337  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4337%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4337">#4337</a></li>

<li><strong>node</strong>: The C++ <code>node::MakeCallback()</code> API is now reentrant and calling it from inside another <code>MakeCallback()</code> call no longer causes the <code>nextTick</code> queue or Promises microtask queue to be processed out of order. (Trevor Norris) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4507  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4507%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4507">#4507</a></li>
<li><strong>tls</strong>: Add a new <code>tlsSocket.getProtocol()</code> method to get the negotiated TLS protocol version of the current connection. (Brian White) <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4995  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4995%27" tppabs="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4995">#4995</a></li>
<li><strong>vm</strong>: Introduce new <code>&#39;produceCachedData&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;cachedData&#39;</code> options to <code>new vm.Script()</code> to interact with V8&#39;s code cache. When a new <code>vm.Script</code> object is created with the <code>&#39;produceCachedData&#39;</code> set to <code>true</code> a <code>Buffer</code> with V8&#39;s code cache data will be produced and stored in <code>cachedData</code> property of the returned object. This data in turn may be supplied back to another <code>vm.Script()</code> object with a <code>&#39;cachedData&#39;</code> option if the supplied source is the same. Successfully executing a script from cached data can speed up instantiation time. See the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_new_vm_script_code_options%27" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_new_vm_script_code_options">API docs</a> for details.
