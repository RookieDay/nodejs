<li><strong>npm</strong>: Upgrade to v3.8.3. Fixes a security flaw in the use of authentication tokens in HTTP requests that 
would allow an attacker to set up a server that could collect tokens from users of the command-line interface. 
Authentication tokens have previously been sent with every request made by the CLI for logged-in users, 
regardless of the destination of the request. This update fixes this by only including those tokens for requests 
made against the registry or registries used for the current install.
