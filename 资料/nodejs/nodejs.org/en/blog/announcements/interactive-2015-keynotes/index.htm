<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20, 2015</strong> – The <a href="../../../foundation/index.htm" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/">Node.js Foundation</a>, a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today announced the final keynotes and programming for <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive%27" tppabs="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive">Node.js Interactive</a>. The event will feature conversations and presentations on everything from the future of Node.js in IoT to collaborations between the community and the enterprise.</p>
<p>Node.js is the runtime of choice for building mobile, web and cloud applications. The diversity of the technology and its capabilities are making it ubiquitous in almost every ecosystem from personal finance to robotics. To highlight changes with the platform and what’s to come, Node.js Interactive will focus on three tracks: Frontend, Backend and the Internet of Things (IoT). Highlights of these tracks available <a href="../interactive-2015-programming/index.htm" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/interactive-2015-programming/">here</a>; full track sessions <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive/program/schedule  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive/program/schedule%27" tppabs="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive/program/schedule">here</a>.</p>
<p>Node.js Interactive brings together a broad range of speakers to help experienced and novice Node.js users alike learn tips, best practices, new skills, as well as gain insight into future developments for the technology.  </p>
