<p><strong>NODE.JS INTERACTIVE 2015, PORTLAND, OR.</strong> — <a href="../../../foundation/index.htm" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/">The Node.js Foundation</a>, a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today announced Apigee, RisingStack and Yahoo are joining the Foundation as Silver Members to build and support the Node.js platform. With over 2 million downloads per month, Node.js is the runtime of choice for developers building everything from enterprise applications to Industrial IoT.</p>
<p>The Node.js Foundation members work together alongside the community to help grow this diverse technology for large financial services, web-scale, cloud computing companies, and more. The newly added <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.2.0/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.2.0/%27" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v4.2.0/">Long-Term Support</a> release version 4.0 is just one of the many initiatives from the Foundation, which addresses the needs of enterprises that are using Node.js in more complex production environments, and signals the growing maturity of the technology.</p>
<p>“We continue to welcome new Node.js Foundation members that are committed to providing the financial and technical resources needed to ensure the technology continues to evolve, while nurturing the community and ecosystem at the same time,” said Danese Cooper, Chairperson of the Node.js Foundation Board. “We are excited to have Apigee, RisingStack, and Yahoo on board to help grow the diversity of the platform and the community.”</p>
<p>The new members are joining just in time for the inaugural Node.js Interactive event taking place today and tomorrow in Portland, OR. The conference focuses on frontend, backend and IoT technologies, and the next big initiatives for the Node.js Foundation. It includes more than 50 tutorials, sessions and keynotes.

Headquartered in San Jose, California, Apigee’s software supports some of the largest global enterprises. Developers can use the Node.js software platform to build highly customized application programming interfaces (APIs) and apps in the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://apigee.com/about/products/api-management  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://apigee.com/about/products/api-management%27" tppabs="http://apigee.com/about/products/api-management">Apigee API management platform</a>. The integration of the Node.js technology allows developers to use code to create specialized APIs in Apigee, while utilizing the huge community of JavaScript developers.</p>
<p>“We want to provide to the developer community the best platform for building today’s modern apps and APIs,,” said Ed Anuff, executive vice president of strategy at Apigee. “We are committed to the advancement of Node.js and look forward to continuing to utilize the strengths and further possibilities of the technology. The Node.js Foundation provides an excellent place for us to help push this technology to become even better for our developers that use it everyday.”</p>
